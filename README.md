## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Swift Technology Implementation

### UI & Architecture
[SwiftUI ‚Äì Used for a modern, declarative, and responsive user interface](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
[Swipe Gestures ‚Äì Implemented for intuitive navigation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/handling-swipe-gestures)
[Lottie Animations (Planned) ‚Äì Will be used to enhance the user experience with smooth animations](https://lottiefiles.com/what-is-lottie)

### Data Storage & Cloud Synchronization

[Firebase Firestore ‚Äì Stores user data, recipes, and ingredient details](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?hl=de)
[Firebase Authentication ‚Äì Manages user login and authentication securely](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?hl=de)

### Networking & API Integration
[URLSession ‚Äì Fetches external data (e.g., ingredient details, sustainability information)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)

### Community & User Interaction (Future Implementation)
[Firebase Firestore ‚Äì Enables user discussions and content sharing within the community section](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?hl=de)

### Performance & Background Processing
[Swift Concurrency (async/await) ‚Äì Ensures smooth and efficient background data fetching and processing](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/)

### Security & Privacy
[Firebase Authentication ‚Äì Manages user authentication and login securely](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?hl=de)

### AI & Smart Features (Future Implementation)
Personalized Recipe Suggestions (Planned) ‚Äì
Easier Approach: Firebase Firestore with simple rule-based filtering (e.g., show recipes based on user preferences)
Advanced Approach: Core ML for machine learning-based personalized recommendations (would require training a model)
Recommendation: Start with the rule-based approach in Firebase and expand later with Core ML for a more advanced experience
